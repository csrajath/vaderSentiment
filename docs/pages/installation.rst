Installation
====================================

There are a couple of ways to install and use VADER sentiment:  

#. The simplest is to use the command line to do an installation from `[PyPI] <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vaderSentiment>`_ using pip, e.g., 
    ``> pip install vaderSentiment``
#. Or, you might already have VADER and simply need to upgrade to the latest version, e.g., 
    ``> pip install --upgrade vaderSentiment``
#. You could also clone this `[GitHub repository] <https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment>`_ 
#. You could download and unzip the `[full master branch zip file] <https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/archive/master.zip>`_ 

In addition to the VADER sentiment analysis Python module, options 3 or 4 will also download all the additional resources and datasets (described below).
